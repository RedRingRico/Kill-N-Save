TryAndSave is a small online game mainly for experimenting with Pike for the
server-side code and C++ for the client-side

The goal is to have a continuous game where many people can come and go as they
please, saving people in the game from dying and killing swathes of monsters
to protect them.  Players must keep a radius around a survivor clear for a
certain period of time until the survivor can be air-lifted out of the area.

Players view the game from a first-person perspective and have access to three
weapons; a shotgun, a pistol, and an assault rifle.

Three platforms will be supported
Linux
Pandora
Windows
